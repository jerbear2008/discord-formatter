Discord Formatter is a tool that helps you format your discord messages. You can use it online [here](https://jerbear2008.github.io/discord-formatter).

## Usage
The formatter works per-line. To format a line, prefix it with a format code. Format codes are a code from this list:

Code | Type      | Format
:---:|:---------:|:------:
i    | Inline    | italic
b    | Inline    | bold
u    | Inline    | underline
s    | Inline    | strikethrough
c    | Inline    | code
q    | Inline    | quote
S    | Inline    | spoiler
r    | Codeblock | red
o    | Codeblock | orange
y    | Codeblock | yellow
g    | Codeblock | green
B    | Codeblock | blue
w    | Codeblock | white
k    | Codeblock | black
I    | Codeblock | italic

Inline formats are the formats built into Discord. You can use multiple at the same time. They are applied in the order they are specified, so use `c` first and `q` last.

Codeblock formats use Discord's codeblocks with specific languages and symbols. This will make Discord highlight your message in a specific color. They cannot be combined with other formats.
